# AdventOfCode
My take on the advent of code challenges by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl).

https://adventofcode.com

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.
-- Excerpt from the about section of the challenge.

I chose to write those challenges using C#, although any language can manage it.

Each challenge will be in its own directory, numbered according to the day of the month.
